We then turn to registration and voter turnout data for the past twenty years, or the last five presidential elections, and compare them at the national, state, and regional levels.  We conclude by exploring data associated with voter characteristics, such as gender, age, race, and education in relation to voter turnout, and reasons for not voting and for not registering."

    "Each state is responsible for setting its own election regulations and administering its elections, as specified by [Article 1 Section 4 of the US Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-4-) (the Constitution does not specify any role for the federal government in terms of administering elections). For most states, voter registration is required prior to voting (the only exception is North Dakota).  States have different voter registration requirements and deadlines.  For example, [California's registration requirements](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/who-can-vote-california/voting-rights-californians/) include: US citizen and resident of California; 18 or over in age on election day; not currently in state or federal prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony, and not currently found mentally incompetent to vote by a court. The deadline for registration is October 19, 2020 for the November 3, 2020 election.  Since registration is a requirement prior to voting for forty-nine states, we pay attention to the *number of registered voters* (**registered**), in addition to the number of eligible voters (**eligible**) and the number of people who voted (**voted**).  Based on these three numbers, we compute the following important measures that we use in this module:\n",
    "- **registration rate** which is the proportion of registered voters out of those who are eligible—**registered/eligible**\n",
    "- **turnout rate** which is the proportion of people who voted out of those who are eligible—**voted/eligible**\n",
    "\n",
    "(A third measure, *turnout rate based on registration*, which is the proportion of people who voted out of those who registered — voted/registered, is worth considering, though in this module we only focus on the first two measures.)"
